# Climalysis

Welcome to Climalysis, a pioneering initiative brought to life by researchers from ETH's Subseasonal to Seasonal research group. As a comprehensive toolkit for climate impact analysis, Climalysis was born from our mission to accelerate climate-related discoveries, boost collaboration, and drive sustainable progress.

The project is rooted in open science principles, pushing the boundaries of what's possible when we demystify climate impact research and make it accessible to all. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a data analyst, a climate enthusiast, or someone keen to learn, we invite you to join us on this journey of exploration and innovation.
