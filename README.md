# Climalysis

Emerging from the dedicated minds of researchers from ETH's Subseasonal to Seasonal research group, Climalysis is more than a mere project - it's a collaborative initiative designed to drive forward our understanding of climate impacts and their patterns.

Our mission is rooted in a passion for uncovering the truths about our ever-changing environment, and a profound belief in the power of shared knowledge and open science. We firmly believe that research shouldn't be hidden behind closed doors, and that's why we're inviting you into our world.

Climalysis is a comprehensive toolkit for climate impact analysis, offering researchers, analysts, and climate enthusiasts an accessible platform for dissecting complex climate data. By bringing our tools into the public sphere, we aim to enhance collaboration, accelerate climate-related discoveries, and ultimately contribute to a more sustainable future.

Whether you're keen on joining the climate conversation, seeking advanced tools for your research, or passionate about innovative methods of data analysis, Climalysis is here to empower your journey. Explore our code, learn with us, contribute your expertise, and together, let's delve deeper into the secrets of our world's climate.

Welcome to Climalysis - because understanding our climate is a shared responsibility.
